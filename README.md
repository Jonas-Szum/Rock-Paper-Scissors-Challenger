# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Challenger
Like another file in this repository, this is a rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock game. Rather than having two players connected at a time, however, the server my partners and I wrote can hold a pre-defined number of players. One player can challenge another player to a game, and the other player has to accept unless they are already in a game.
